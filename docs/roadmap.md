### Manifest Configuration Features 📋

#### Slot Configuration

```toml
[[tool.flavor.slots]]
id = "config"
source = "config/"
purpose = "configuration"
lifecycle = "persistent"
extract_to = "{workenv}/config"
permissions = "0644"
```

**Status**: 📋 Planned
**Use Case**: Enable custom slot purposes, lifecycles, platform-specific slots, and lazy-loaded content

#### Python Version Selection

```toml
[tool.flavor.python]
version = "3.11"  # Exact version to use
min_version = "3.11"  # Minimum acceptable
max_version = "3.13"  # Maximum acceptable
