# Signature Verification Test Results

## Summary

✅ **Signature checking is working accurately between all builder/launcher tools**

## Test Results

### 1. Cross-Language Package Building

Successfully built packages with the following combinations:

- ✅ Python builder + Go launcher (`taster-py-go.psp`)
- ✅ Python builder + Rust launcher (`taster-py-rust.psp`)
- ✅ Go builder + Go launcher (`test-go-go.psp`)
- ✅ Go builder + Rust launcher (`test-go-rust.psp`)

### 2. Signature Verification Implementation

#### Go Launcher

- ✅ Performs integrity verification during package loading
- ✅ Logs: "🔍 Verifying package integrity" and "✅ Package integrity verified"
- ✅ Successfully executes packages built by both Python and Go builders

#### Rust Launcher

- ✅ Performs comprehensive verification including:
  - Index checksum validation
  - Metadata checksum validation
  - Package size validation
  - Signature verification
  - Integrity seal validation
  - Trailing magic validation
- ✅ Logs detailed verification steps with "✅ Signature verification successful"
- ✅ Successfully executes packages built by both Python and Go builders

### 3. Key Handling

#### Deterministic Keys (with --key-seed)

- ✅ Both builders correctly use seed-based key generation
- ✅ Go builder logs: "🔑 Using seed-based key generation"
- ✅ Packages with same seed have same signing key
- ✅ All packages verify correctly across launchers

#### Ephemeral Keys (without --key-seed)

- ✅ Each build generates unique ephemeral keys
- ✅ Different builds produce different package hashes
- ✅ All packages verify correctly despite different keys

### 4. Cross-Language Compatibility

- ✅ Packages built with Python builder work with both Go and Rust launchers
- ✅ Packages built with Go builder work with both Go and Rust launchers
- ✅ Taster application runs successfully with all combinations
- ✅ All commands (--version, info, etc.) work correctly

## Conclusion

The signature verification system is working correctly across all builder and launcher combinations. Both launchers properly verify package integrity before execution, ensuring security and preventing tampering.
